# CovidS

CovidS was designed for a college project, it is not for profit or publicity.

The app brings the results in real time using the API consumption through the Retrofit library and distributing it throughout the app.

The app also uses a graph that displays the data in a distributed way, with the possibility to filter by continent for a better visualization of the data.
